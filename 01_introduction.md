# Introduction

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a simple iOS application using AWS Amplify, a set of tools and serverless services in the cloud. In the first module, you‚Äôll build a simple iOS application. Through the remaining modules, you will initialize a local app using the Amplify Command Line Interface (Amplify CLI), add user authentication, add a GraphQL API and a database to store your data, and update your app to store images.

## What you Will Learn

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create a simple iOS application discussed above. You will learn to:

- Manage serverless cloud backend from the command line

- Add auth to your app to enable sign-in and sign-out

- Add a GraphQL API, database, and storage solution

- Share your backend between multiple projects.

## Modules

This tutorial is divided into five short modules. You must complete each module in order, before moving on to the next one.

- [Create an iOS App](02_create_ios_app.md) (10 minutes): Create an iOS app and test it in the iPhone simulator.

- [Initialize a Local App](03_initialize_amplify.md) (10 minutes): Initialize a local app using AWS Amplify.

- [Add Authentication](04_add_authentication.md) (10 minutes): Add auth to your application.

- [Add a GraphQL API and Database](05_add_api_database.md) (20 minutes): Create a GraphQL API.

- [Add the Ability to Store Images](06_add_storage.md) (10 minutes): Add storage to your app.

You will be building this iOS application using the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) and Apple's [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) IDE.

## Tutorial pre-requisites

To follow this tutorial, you need the following tools and resources:

- [Xcode 15.x](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or more recent, available on the [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12s).
- an [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) with at least [these permissions](/amplify-policy.json) (an `Administrator` role or `root` account will also work, but we recommend a [least-privileges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) approach).
- [NodeJS 22.4](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or more recent.
- AWS Command Line Interface [AWS CLI 2.17.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) or more recent.

You can install these tools following these instructions:

```zsh
# install brew itself
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# install python3 and pip3
brew install python3

# install the AWS CLI
brew install awscli

# install Node.js & npm
brew install node

```

Once installed, you should have **at least the versions shown below** (anything more recent is valid !) :

```zsh
brew --version
# Homebrew 4.3.9-38-g4bd3b93
# Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 6b117484622; last commit 2024-07-03)
# Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 75f95ae22c; last commit 2024-07-03)

python3 --version
# Python 3.12.4

aws --version
# aws-cli/2.17.5 Python/3.11.9 Darwin/23.5.0 source/arm64

node --version
# v22.4.0

```
